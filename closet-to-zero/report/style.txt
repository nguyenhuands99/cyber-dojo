/sandbox/closet_to_zero.py:28:1: W391 blank line at end of file

^
    Trailing blank lines are superfluous.

    Okay: spam(1)
    W391: spam(1)\n

    However the last line should end with a new line (warning W292).

    Separate top-level function and class definitions with two blank
    lines.

    Method definitions inside a class are separated by a single blank
    line.

    Extra blank lines may be used (sparingly) to separate groups of
    related functions.  Blank lines may be omitted between a bunch of
    related one-liners (e.g. a set of dummy implementations).

    Use blank lines in functions, sparingly, to indicate logical
    sections.

    Okay: def a():\n    pass\n\n\ndef b():\n    pass
    Okay: def a():\n    pass\n\n\nasync def b():\n    pass
    Okay: def a():\n    pass\n\n\n# Foo\n# Bar\n\ndef b():\n    pass
    Okay: default = 1\nfoo = 1
    Okay: classify = 1\nfoo = 1

    E301: class Foo:\n    b = 0\n    def bar():\n        pass
    E302: def a():\n    pass\n\ndef b(n):\n    pass
    E302: def a():\n    pass\n\nasync def b(n):\n    pass
    E303: def a():\n    pass\n\n\n\ndef b(n):\n    pass
    E303: def a():\n\n\n\n    pass
